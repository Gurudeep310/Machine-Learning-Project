Here there are 4 Projects which I have worked on:
Project 1 Description: Imagine you are working in a fashion e-commerce startup. Various details of the customers are captured. Your team wants to devise business strategies based on the spending pattern of customers. So you have to predict the yearly amount spent by your customers based on the available data.

Project 2 Description: Given 6 different type of plastics we need to help classify the type of plastic.

Project 3 Description: Given 4 different potions we need to classify them accordingly

Project 4 Description: Predict prices of the car based on various features available in each car.
